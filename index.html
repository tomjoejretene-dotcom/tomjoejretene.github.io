  <h1> Example Title: Integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into education </h1>
  
  <h2>Example Abstract</h2>
  <p>The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into education is becoming increasingly common, with applications
    ranging from personalized learning systems to automated grading tools. This project explores various ways AI is
    being used in educational environments, highlighting its potential to improve teaching efficiency, support students
    with special needs, and tailor learning content to individual learners. However, alongside these benefits come
    important risks and challenges, such as data privacy concerns, algorithmic bias, and overdependence on technology.
    By examining the social, ethical, and technical implications of AI in education, this project aims to develop a
    comprehensive framework for responsible and sustainable AI integration in teaching and learning practices.</p>
